# Shadow coding authoring-lease delivery

Platform exposes one authenticated authoring-only route:

```text
POST /api/v1/validator/coding-shadow/authoring-lease
```

The request signs a domain-separated message over validator hotkey, ticket
UUID, one-use nonce, and UTC request timestamp. Platform verifies the signature,
freshness, current chain permit, nonce, and ticket ownership before reading the
private catalog. A wrong-validator or expired ticket therefore cannot trigger a
private object read.

Platform then reconstructs the complete task lease, rechecks the current exact
artifact certification, and invokes an authoring-only minter. That minter
neither checks nor signs the grader object. The wire response contains exactly
these ordered capabilities:

```text
visible-bundle
memory-bundle
resource-profile
```

The response binds the shared run manifest and digest, task-set digest,
repository epoch, issue/runtime/budget material and digests, ticket deadline,
and `weight_eligible=false`. It is `Cache-Control: no-store`. Grader capability,
grader tests, gold patches, catalog coordinates, source URLs, policy labels,
and curator metadata are structurally absent.

The root validator client has a typed request method with a 512 KiB response
ceiling and redacted parse errors. No worker or scheduler calls the method.

## Activation boundary

This route can serve only an already-issued explicit shadow ticket. No
production scheduler issues work to it, no validator worker invokes it, and it
does not start a workspace, issue a Luna grant, grade a patch, write a score,
deploy a service, or affect emissions. Coding contract v1 remains permanently
weight-ineligible.
