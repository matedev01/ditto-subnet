# Separate shadow coding evaluation ledger

Platform persists DittoBench Coding results in tables and endpoints that are
separate from the ordinary tool-and-memory score pipeline. Coding contract v1
and every stored result are permanently `weight_eligible=false`.

## Authority chain

One immutable shared run fixes the following for every validator:

```text
agent UUID and source artifact SHA-256
screened image SHA-256
benchmark and coding contract versions
corpus release and catalog commitment
chain-derived selection authority
inference and grader contract digests
task-set and canonical run-manifest digests
task count
exact core-qualification observation
```

A run can be created only while that exact artifact has a current complete core
qualification. Each validator-specific ticket then binds the run to one active
artifact certification that remains valid through the two-hour maximum lease.
All validators under a run therefore share one task-set manifest while retaining
separate ticket IDs, deadlines, certifications, signatures, and result rows.

This layer intentionally provides no production run or ticket issuer. The
signed catalog/exposure layer requires a registered active commitment and full
irreversible exposure before any new ticket. The separate selector core can
verify one assigned block and private task proof, but it neither persists the
future-height assignment nor schedules or inserts a run. The validator
submission route therefore has no live lease to accept. Internal insertion
functions and real PostgreSQL tests freeze the authority contract for that
later work.

Persisting a selection block number/hash is not chain verification. The selector
core independently fetches the canonical block hash and validates the selected
manifest; re-hashing a Platform-supplied string is explicitly insufficient.
The future issuer must additionally prove that its immutable height assignment
predates revelation.

## Signed results

`POST /api/v1/validator/agent/{agent_id}/coding-shadow-result` accepts a result
only when:

- the permitted validator signs the agent, run, ticket, benchmark, deadline,
  screened image, and canonical run-evidence digest;
- the immutable ticket belongs to that validator and shared run;
- the agent artifact and screened image still match;
- the referenced capability certification is exact and unexpired;
- the coding run ID, contract, manifest digests, task count, and ticket identity
  match the lease;
- the run evidence reproduces its terminal-domain counts and binary repair mean.

Exact transport replay is idempotent. Reusing a run, ticket, or result identity
for different authority returns a conflict. Infrastructure, invalid-task, and
control-plane outcomes remain non-scoreable; resolved, repair-failure, and
candidate-integrity outcomes form the integer repair mean. The ledger never
writes `scores` and no rank, queue, validator weight, or emissions path reads it.

## Operator visibility

`GET /api/v1/admin/agents/{agent_id}/coding-shadow-evaluations` returns bounded
run, lease, and signed-result summaries. It exposes commitments and aggregates,
not full run evidence, private task identities, hidden tests, repository bytes,
or patches. Backroom serves the same read through
`get_agent_coding_shadow_evaluations`.

The view reports a repair median only after three validator results. A source
artifact, screened image, or core-policy change marks historical runs stale
without deleting or relabeling them.

## Activation boundary

This ledger is calibration infrastructure, not a second emissions authority.
Production still requires the persisted assignment/issuer, private catalog
transport, shadow scheduler, validator/scorer adapter, and measured calibration.
Any coding emissions allocation requires coding contract v2 and a separate
owner-approved PR.
