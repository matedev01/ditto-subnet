class EfficiencyBonus(Base):
    """One agent's frozen relative token-efficiency adjustment (version >= 7).

    Insert-once per ``(agent_id, bench_version, epoch_index)``: assigned against
    the frozen cohort snapshot of that epoch (strictly-upside zero rows included,
    so "no bonus" is as frozen as "5%") and **never updated**, so a published
    effective score can never drift. Legacy curves derive
    ``effective_composite = composite * (1 + bonus)``; bounded curve v3 derives
    downside as ``composite * factor`` and upside against the remaining quality
    headroom. The validator's base composite is never modified.

    The key carries ``epoch_index`` because the bonus is *relative*: it is a
    position against a cohort's token distribution, and that distribution moves.
    Without the epoch in the key the row was insert-once per bench version
    FOREVER, so an agent that became more efficient could never earn a better
    bonus, and an agent measured mid-transition kept that measurement for the
    life of the contract. That happened at 04:43Z on 2026-07-26, part-way
    through the 4M -> 25M token-budget change.

    ``bench_version`` stays in the key and stays load-bearing: a bonus earned
    under one benchmark contract is meaningless under another (different
    dataset, different difficulty, different token profile). Epoch scoping is
    strictly *inside* version scoping, not a replacement for it.

    Recomputation is additive, never destructive. A new epoch writes a NEW row;
    prior epochs' rows are untouched, so ``/public/efficiency/snapshots/{id}``
    stays immutable and the audit trail is complete. The sole compatibility
    exception is a curve-v3 ``factor IS NULL, bonus = 0`` placeholder written
    by the immediately previous binary during deploy/rollback: it carries no
    scoring authority and may be promoted once to a signed factor by the v3
    writer. A database trigger neutralizes that old writer and rejects factors
    attached to legacy snapshots.

    A submission is scored by exactly three validators. The platform issues at
    most three tickets per agent, each to a *distinct* validator hotkey, and
    refuses further requests ("no job for you"). A ticket is the right to score:
    the validator loads the agent + the platform-generated dataset, scores it,
    and must post the signed score back before ``deadline`` or the ticket
    expires and its slot re-opens for another validator.

    The composite primary key ``(agent_id, validator_hotkey)`` enforces
    distinctness — a validator can hold at most one ticket per agent, so it can
    never occupy two of the three slots and skew the median. ``agent_id`` is a
    single-column FK to ``agents.agent_id`` with ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` because a
    ticket is derived from a live submission.

    The three composites themselves live in :class:`Score` (one row per
    ``(agent, validator)``); a ticket tracks only issuance, the deadline, and
    lifecycle. An agent finalizes (median-of-three) once it has three

    ``mnemo*`` leases to ``fail_job(reason="infrastructure")`` and still could not

    A value ending in ``...[truncated, N chars]`` is an amputated message, not a

    injected credentials masked and URL query strings stripped -- but no wire
    carried it, so it reached a human only by shelling into whichever validator

    Agent ``5fdadd33`` burned four leases in 82-108 seconds each and left four

    """Which metering contract booked this grant's token counters.

    A token total is only comparable within the contract that produced it --
    the same axis as ``bench_version`` for scores, and for the same reason.

    ``1`` -- reservations were ``max_tokens + len(body)``, byte length used as a
    token count, roughly 4x the truth. Any request that did not return trusted
    provider usage (timeout, transport failure, revocation, or a stale sweep)
    was charged that inflated figure as ``prompt_tokens``.

    ``2`` -- reservations are a real token estimate, so a reclaimed request is
    charged approximately what it cost.

    Successful calls booked the provider's own numbers under both versions, so
    the two differ only on the unsettled tail. The marker exists anyway: without
    it, someone comparing a v1 run against a v2 run later concludes an agent got
    dramatically more efficient when only the meter changed. There is no
    backfill and there cannot be one -- the over-charge happened at reservation
    time, so what those calls really consumed was never recorded.

    Retirement is a *generational* fact, not a verdict. It records that the

    closed underneath it. The payment, artifact, screening record, accepted

    Deliberately a sibling of :class:`ValidatorQueueWithdrawal` rather than a
    reuse of it. The two answer different questions and a reader must be able to
    tell them apart:

    * a **withdrawal** says the submission burned its slots and can no longer
      reach quorum on its own; it is scoped to a benchmark version because a
      later era is a fresh eligibility decision.
    * a **retirement** says the submission never got the chance, because the
      subnet moved to a newer benchmark generation. It names the version that
      closed (``bench_version``) and the version that superseded it
      (``superseded_by_version``), so the miner-facing copy can say which
      generation their work belonged to.

    Retirement is also deliberately *not* an :class:`AgentStatus` value. That
    enum is the screener/platform wire contract shipped by
    ``ditto-screening-protocol``, and :data:`SCOREABLE_AGENT_STATUSES` feeds the

    Every path that hands a caller miner source (the tarball, a source file, a

    table the only trace of an artifact fetch was a stdout line, so an artifact
    leak could be observed in its consequences and never attributed to a
    fetcher. This is the forensic record that answers "who fetched this
    artifact, and when".

    Insert-only and *not* FK-bound to ``agents``: the record must outlive the
    submission it describes, exactly as :class:`ScoreAuditEntry` does. An agent
    row may be pruned; the history of who read its source must not cascade away.

    Deliberately *not* hash-chained. :class:`ScoreAuditEntry` serializes every
    append on a ``FOR UPDATE`` head lock to keep one linear chain; that is the
    right trade for a public tamper-evident score projection, and the wrong one
    for a read-path audit, where it would turn concurrent artifact fetches into
    a queue behind a single row. This table takes plain concurrent INSERTs.

    ``requester_kind`` is a closed vocabulary; ``requester_id`` is that kind's
    identity (validator hotkey, screener hotkey, admin actor) and is NULL only
    for the unauthenticated public path, where no identity exists to record.

    Distinct from :class:`ValidatorLeaseAudit`, which records lease *revocations*
    — a destructive write the platform performs on a validator. This records
    *reads* a caller performs against miner source. They share neither a
    requester model (that table is validator-only and requires a hotkey, a slot
    and a bench version on every row; fetches also arrive from an
    identity-less public route and a shared-hotkey screener fleet) nor a query
    shape, so they stay separate tables.

    One row per *fetch*, never updated. ``validator_tickets`` is keyed by
    ``(agent_id, bench_version, validator_hotkey)`` and is UPSERTed on reissue,
    so a repeated claim/fail loop collapses into one row with an inflated
    ``attempt_count`` and only the latest ``issued_at``. Because a fetch appends
    here instead, that same loop leaves one durable row per artifact hand-off —
    the per-lease history the ticket table cannot keep.

    A miner signs a claim over a normalized name stem (``jupiter`` covers

    payment-owner family endorse it. Once the endorsement threshold is
