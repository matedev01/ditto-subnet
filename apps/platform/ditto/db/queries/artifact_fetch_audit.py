"""Record who was served a miner artifact, and when.

Every path that hands a caller miner source — the tarball bytes, a presigned
URL to them, a single source file, a source diff — appends one row to
``artifact_fetch_audit`` through :func:`record_artifact_fetch`.

Two properties matter more than anything else here:

**The audit must never deny a legitimate fetch.** A validator holding a valid
scoring ticket has already proved possession of its hotkey, passed the chain
permit check, and burned a nonce. If the audit INSERT then fails — a full disk,
a lock timeout, a migration mid-flight — refusing the artifact would convert a
logging fault into a scoring outage across the fleet. So this function is
fail-open: it returns ``False`` and logs, and never raises. The cost is
explicit and accepted: a fetch can happen without leaving a row. That is why
the failure is logged at ``exception`` level under a stable, greppable message
(:data:`AUDIT_WRITE_FAILED`) — a silent audit gap is the one outcome worse than
a loud one, and alerting keys off that string.

**It must not serialize the read path.** Unlike ``score_audit_log``, which
takes a ``FOR UPDATE`` lock on the chain head to keep one linear hash chain,
this table is a plain insert with no chain and no head lock, so concurrent
fetches never queue behind each other.

Writes are synchronous and unbatched, deliberately. Artifact fetches are
bounded by work issuance, not by request traffic: k=3 validator tickets per
agent per benchmark era, one screener claim per screening attempt, and a
handful of operator reads. That is single-digit rows per submission — orders of
magnitude below where INSERT batching earns its cost. Batching would also trade
away exactly the property the table exists for: an in-memory buffer loses its
contents on the crash or kill you most want the record of. If volume ever does
grow, the table is append-only and range-partitionable on ``fetched_at``
without touching any caller.
