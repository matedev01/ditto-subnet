// pm2 process definition for the Ditto Platform API.
//
// The API is a long-lived host process; Postgres/MinIO/Pylon stay in Docker.
// Env is loaded from .env plus optional .env.deploy by scripts/start.sh or
// scripts/update.sh before pm2 starts (pm2 inherits the parent environment), so
// this file does not parse environment files itself.
//
//   pm2 start scripts/ecosystem.config.js --update-env
//   pm2 logs ditto-api
//   pm2 reload scripts/ecosystem.config.js --update-env   # see "Restarts" below
//
// !! CHANGING `script`, `interpreter`, `interpreter_args`, `exec_mode`, OR `cwd`
// !! REQUIRES RECREATING THE APP, NOT RELOADING IT.
// `pm2 reload` reconciles `args` and env but keeps those five fields from pm2's
// saved dump, so a reload after editing them relaunches the OLD program with the
// NEW args. That is exactly how moving `script` from `uv` to `.venv/bin/python`
// took prod down: pm2 ran `/usr/local/bin/uv -m ditto.api_server`, uv exited on
// `unexpected argument '-m' found`, and the API sat in `waiting restart` with
// pid 0 behind a 502.
// scripts/update.sh detects this automatically (scripts/pm2_deploy_plan.js diffs
// the running launch identity and recreates the app when it drifted), so a normal
// deploy is safe. Doing it by hand: `pm2 delete <app>` then `pm2 start`.
//
// Launcher: the venv interpreter is invoked DIRECTLY, not via `uv run`.
// `uv run` does not exec into the interpreter -- it forks it as a child process
// and proxies signals -- so pm2 ends up owning a ~59 MB launcher shim while the
// real uvicorn server (measured ~950 MB RSS in prod) lives in a grandchild pm2
// cannot see. Every per-process pm2 control measures the shim under that
// layout, which silently neutered `max_memory_restart`: the guard read ~59 MB
// forever and could never fire no matter how large the server grew.
//
// Both scripts/start.sh and scripts/update.sh run `uv sync` before they touch
// pm2, so .venv is always current by the time pm2 reads this file. Resolving the
// interpreter here costs that one implicit re-sync per launch and buys pm2
// ownership of the process that actually holds the memory.

const path = require("path");
const root = path.resolve(__dirname, "..");
// `uv sync` always materializes this; it is the same interpreter `uv run` would
// have selected, minus the intervening shim process.
const venvPython = path.join(root, ".venv", "bin", "python");

// --- Inference relay pool -------------------------------------------------
//
// Ports must stay in sync with app_health_url_for() in scripts/update.sh and
// with platform_inference_relay_ports in the infra platform_app role, which
// renders the Caddy upstreams.
const RELAY_PORTS = [8010, 8011];

// TWO relays, not one, from the start. Measured on prod (e2-standard-4):
// `ditto-api` sits at 84% of ONE core serving 10.8 req/s, and inference is
// 71.7% of requests / 81.7% of in-flight request-time. A single relay would
// therefore inherit ~60-69% of one core AT TODAY'S LOAD -- not headroom, and
// it only gets worse as validator slot concurrency ramps. Two relays land at
// ~30-34% each. The marginal cost is one pm2 entry and one port; the cost of
// getting it wrong is rediscovering the single-event-loop ceiling in
// production, which is the whole thing this change exists to stop.
//
// POSTGRES_POOL_MAX_SIZE=12 is what makes two relays fit under the CURRENT
// max_connections=100 on ditto-pg-platform without a Postgres restart:
//   platform 30 + dev 30 + 2x12 = 84, +3 superuser-reserved = 87 of 100.
// Observed live usage is 16 total, and the DB duty cycle of an inference
// request is small (~15 short ORM statements inside a ~300 ms p50 request that
// is mostly awaiting OpenRouter), so 12 is ample. Raise it to 20 only after
// max_connections goes up -- that is a postmaster setting and needs a full
// database RESTART, so it is a separate, quieter change.
const relayApp = (port, index) => ({
  // The Go model-relay binary serving /health, /metrics,
  // /api/v1/inference/*, and the narrow upload pricing/admission slice. The
  // Python ditto-api keeps multipart /upload/agent and every other route.
  // Caddy load-balances /api/v1/inference/* across the two slots, so the
  // proxy hot path never shares an event loop with validator heartbeat ingest
  // -- which is what lets the platform force-expire live leases and destroy
  // healthy in-flight runs.
  //
  // !! The binary exists ONLY inside a relay release dir
  // !! (/opt/ditto-platform-relay/releases/<sha>/model-relay). Starting the
  // !! relay apps from the git checkout (where this file also lives) will
  // !! crash-loop: relays are rolled exclusively by deploy-relay-release.sh,
  // !! which starts this file from the release dir; update.sh and start.sh
  // !! must keep skipping ditto-api-relay-*.
  //
  // !! MOVING FROM THE PYTHON WHEEL RELAY TO THIS BINARY CHANGES `script`,
  // !! WHICH REQUIRES RECREATING THE APP, NOT RELOADING IT (see the header).
  // !! deploy-relay-release.sh always does delete+start per slot, so the
  // !! transition release is safe only through the relay-release path --
  // !! never via a manual `pm2 reload`.
  //
  // !! NEVER set exec_mode: "cluster" on this or any app here. pm2's cluster
  // !! mode is Node's `cluster` module: God.js does
  // !! cluster.setupMaster({exec: ProcessContainer.js}) and ClusterMode.js
  // !! `God.nodeApp` calls cluster.fork(), so every worker is a NODE process.
  // !! pm2 only auto-selects cluster mode for a node/bun interpreter
  // !! (Common.js determineExecMode), but an EXPLICIT exec_mode is passed
  // !! straight through with NO interpreter check -- so pm2 would accept it
  // !! and then try to require() the venv python binary as JavaScript,
  // !! crash-looping the app. Verified against pm2 7.0.3 on the prod host.
