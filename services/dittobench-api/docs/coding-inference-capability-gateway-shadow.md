# Shadow coding inference capability gateway

`internal/codinggateway` is the disabled validator-local composition layer for
one ticket-bound Luna capability. It joins the reviewed
`codingplatform.Client`, `codingrelayjournal.Store`, and `codingrelay.Relay`
without adding a listener, worker, scheduler, score, or deployment setting.

## Fresh activation

`Activate` accepts one already-exchanged Platform grant and an empty private
mode-`0700` journal directory. It opens and locks the journal, durably commits
the attempt binding, requires a trusted authorizer to prove the outbox
activation marker already committed, then constructs the secret-owning
Platform client and relay before asking a trusted publisher to mount the
handler behind one opaque, source-bound base URL. A journal with any prior
binding is never republished.

The future attempt owner must reserve the durable evidence outbox and commit
its non-rerunnable `BeginTranscript` activation marker before calling
`Activate`. This package deliberately cannot manufacture that authority.

The miner receives only the base URL. It never receives the Platform bearer,
broker signing key, model-relay route, provider credential, journal path, or
grant-control fields. A caller-supplied HTTP transport is a trusted test or
integration dependency; production uses the hardened no-proxy, no-redirect
transport owned by `codingplatform.Client`.

## Revocation and evidence

Revocation is serialized and ordered:

1. revoke the source-bound outer route so no new miner request is admitted;
2. revoke the relay, waiting for an admitted dispatch to settle durably;
3. revoke the exact Platform grant generation;
4. permit deterministic model evidence finalization.

Every step is idempotent. A lost Platform revocation response is retried with
the same ticket, case, profile, grant, generation, policy digest, and deadline.
`Close` is refused before the complete revocation sequence and deletes no
journal evidence.

## Restart recovery

`Recover` accepts no bearer, broker private key, provider transport, or
publisher. It never recreates a miner-visible route. A journal containing only
completed settlements is durably revoked and can reproduce exact model
evidence. An incomplete dispatch marker means the provider outcome is unknown
and is terminally ambiguous: the local and Platform grants are revoked and the
request is never repeated.

The future gateway/worker remains responsible for mapping that typed outcome,
persisting the complete signed Platform publication envelope, coordinating the
harness and workspace capability, and retaining both journal and outbox until
terminal acknowledgement.

## Activation boundary

No production composition root imports this package. No deployment file
enables the coding model-relay gate, and no scheduler calls the gateway. Coding
contract v1 remains permanently `weight_eligible=false`.

Validation:

```bash
cd services/dittobench-api
go test -race ./internal/codinggateway ./internal/codingplatform \
  ./internal/codingrelay ./internal/codingrelayjournal
go vet ./internal/codinggateway ./internal/codingplatform \
  ./internal/codingrelay ./internal/codingrelayjournal
```
