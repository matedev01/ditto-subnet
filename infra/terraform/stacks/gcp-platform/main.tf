# ditto-platform (Bittensor Subnet 118 API) — persistent GCP infrastructure.
#
# Unlike envs/gcp-prod (the unapplied backend migration), this stack stands on
# its own: its OWN VPC, its OWN dedicated Postgres VM, and one small app VM per
# deploy env. The app runs as a host process under pm2/uv with Pylon as a Docker
# sidecar (NOT Cloud Run) — see the ditto-subnet repo's scripts/ + the infra
# `platform_app` Ansible role.
#
#   Postgres                 -> dedicated GCE VM (private)   [modules/compute/gcp]
#   ditto-platform-{dev,prod}-> GCE app VMs (public IP)      [modules/compute/gcp]
#   agent tarballs           -> GCS buckets (S3 interop/HMAC)
#   platform-api[-dev]       -> Cloudflare A -> app VM IP    [modules/dns/cloudflare]
#
# Deploy flow (lives in the ditto-subnet repo): push dev|main -> WIF ->
# IAP SSH into the matching VM -> scripts/update.sh (git pull, uv sync, alembic
# upgrade, pm2 reload). Terraform owns only the persistent layer below.
