# Default-off shadow coding worker

The shadow coding pipeline now has one complete composition path, but every
release keeps it disabled by default and every coding artifact remains
`weight_eligible=false`.

## Runtime order

The validator runs a separate `CodingShadowWorker` beside the ordinary
tool/memory scoring loop only when `VALIDATOR_CODING_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`.
For one stable worker instance it:

1. claims one Platform coding ticket;
2. proves the private scorer handoff and fetches the non-executing authoring,
   screened-harness, and Luna-grant authority while the claim is transferable;
3. commits the Platform `start` boundary before invoking candidate code;
4. heartbeats the exact claim generation while work is active;
5. calls the private Go supervisor for authoring and pristine grading;
6. stores the exact signed authoring-freeze request in the Go outbox before
   Platform transmission and stores the exact verified acknowledgement after;
7. obtains the freeze-bound grading lease, runs the protected grader, and uses
   the same prepare -> publish -> acknowledge order for terminal evidence.

The Go host is constructed only when
`DITTOBENCH_CODING_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`. It composes the phase-specific Docker
executor factory, artifact fetcher, scoped memory projector, durable outbox,
dormant screened-harness controller, direct-source registry, opaque workspace
and Luna routes, relay journal, attempt supervisor, publication service, and a
bounded outbox sweep loop.
The relay-journal root has a durable directory-cardinality ceiling equal to the
host attempt bound; an unexpected entry or exhausted root fails closed instead
of allocating unbounded restart residue.

Authoring and grading do not share one prebuilt executor. Authoring receives
only the selected public environment-image digest and the validator-only
resource profile. The complete protected grader manifest is accepted only
after Platform returns the freeze-gated grading lease.

## Recovery

A started claim is never reassigned to another instance. On restart the same
instance asks the supervisor for durable state:

- `terminal_pending` reopens and republishes only the exact stored request;
- `authoring_pending` publishes the exact stored freeze, then continues from
  the acknowledged immutable patch;
- `authoring_published` reloads the stored request and acknowledgement and may
  enter pristine grading without rerunning candidate authoring;
- `released` is already complete;
- `none`, `ambiguous`, and `expired` never execute candidate code again.

Restored grading is admitted only when the phase runner independently observes
the acknowledged authoring publication in the durable outbox and the supplied
authoring evidence matches that outbox record. Process-local session loss by
itself grants no retry.
Terminal acknowledgement advances the outbox to `released`; observing that
durable state is also the only point where the supervisor may evict its
process-local session tombstone.

## Activation checklist

Activation is deliberately a coordinated operator action, not a code default.
All of the following must be configured together:

- Platform: `DITTO_CODING_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`, the canonical locked policy
  file, and exact HTTPS exchange, proxy, and revocation URLs;
- scorer: `DITTOBENCH_CODING_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`, an euid-owned mode-0700
  private root, the canonical locked policy file, the source-bound port/base
  URL, and the reviewed runtime-image repository with every selected immutable
  environment/grader digest preloaded on the dedicated daemon;
- sandbox: a dedicated rootless daemon with the isolated-daemon label, the
  capability-only egress network, and an explicit allowlisting proxy;
- validator: `VALIDATOR_CODING_SHADOW_ENABLED=true`, one stable instance ID,
  and the existing private scorer control token.

Setting only a subset fails closed: no ticket is claimed, or startup rejects
the incomplete runtime. The committed Compose values keep both worker gates
false. This PR does not deploy the Platform transport configuration, change a
benchmark version, combine coding with ordinary scoring, alter emissions, or
enable a leaderboard weight.
